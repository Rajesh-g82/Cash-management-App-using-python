Build a simple Cash Management Application using Python that will be used by the cashier at the counter in the bank. 

The application should provide the facility to:
1. Add a new customer to the system by accepting a minimum amount of $30
2. Allow deposit of additional cash for an existing customer
3. Allow cash withdrawal up to a cash-balance limit of $30 for an existing customer
4. Retire an existing customer; delete a customer from the system only if the balance is below $30
5. Allow the display of all customers
6. Allow the user/cashier to quit the application


The customers below should be present in the system. Store this data in your program in a nested dictionary object with appropriate keys and perform the required transactions on them.

custID 	Name	Cash Balance
C01	Jane		5500
C02	Suzanne	6200
C03	Martha		5800
C04	Tom		7000
